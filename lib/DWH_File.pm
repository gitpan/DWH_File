=head1 NAME

DWH_File 0.1 - data and object persistence in deep and wide hashes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use DWH_File qw/ GDBM_File /;
    # the use arguments set the DBM module used, the file locking scheme
    # and the log files name extension

    tie( %h, DWH_File, 'myFile', O_RDWR|O_CREAT, 0644 );

    untie( %h ); # essential!

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Note: the files produced by DWH_File 0.1 are in a different format
and are incompatible with the files produced by previous versions.

DWH_File is used in a manner resembling NDBM_File, DB_File etc. These
DBM modules are limited to storing flat scalar values. References to data
such as arrays or hashes are stored as useless strings and the data in the
referenced structures will be lost.

DWH_File uses one of the DBM modules (configurable through the parameters
to C<use()>), but extends the functionality to not only save referenced data
structures but even object systems.

This is why I made it. It makes it extremely simple to achieve persistence in
object oriented Perl programs and you can skip the cumbersome interaction with
a conventional database.

DWH_File tries to make the tied hash behave as much like a standard Perl hash
as possible. Besides the capability to store nested data structures DWH_File
also implements C<exists()>, C<delete()> and C<undef()> functionality like
that of a standard hash (as opposed to all the DBM modules).

=head2 MULTIPLE DBM FILES

It is possible to distribute for instance an object system over several files
if wanted. This might be practical to avoid huge single files and may also
make it easier make a reasonable structure in the data. If this feature is
used the same set of files should be tied each time if any of the contents
that may refer across files is altered. See L<MODELS>.

=head2 GARBAGE COLLECTION

DWH_File uses a garbage collection scheme similar to that of Perl itself.
This means that you actually don't have to worry about freeing anything
(see the circular reference caveat though).
Just like Perl DWH_File will remove entries that nothing is pointing to (and
therefore noone can ever get at). If you've got a key whose value refers to an
array for instance, that array will be swept away if you assign something else
to the key. Unless there's a reference to the array somewhere else in the
structure. This works even across different dbm files when using multiple
files.

The garbage collection housekeeping is performed at untie time - so it is 
mandatory to call untie (and if you keep any references to the tied object
to undef those in advance). Otherwise you'll leave the object at the mercy
of global destruction and garbage won't be properly collected.

=head2 MUTUAL EXCLUSION

Ealier versions had some specialized locking schemes to deal with
concurrency in eg. web-applications. I havn't put any into this
version, and I think I'll leave them out to avoid scope creep.

The reason for having those features were that locking dbm-files
isn't as straightforward as locking ordinary files. I find now, that
the best solution is to use some of the generalized mechanisms for
handling concurrency. There are some fine perl modules for
facilitating the use of semaphores for instance.

=head2 LOGGING

Earlier versions had a logging feature. I haven't put it into
this new generation of DWH_File yet. If you need it, send me a mail.
That might tempt me.

=head2 FURTHER INFORMATION

http://www.orqwood.dk/perl5/dwh/ - home of the DWH_File.

As of this writing, there's nothing much there, but I hope to find
time to make a series of examples and templates to show just how
beautiful life can be if you only remember to

   use DWH_File;

=head1 MODELS

=head2 A typical script using DWH_File

    use Fcntl;
    use DWH_File;
    # with no extra parameters to use() DWH_File defaults to:
    # AnyDBM_File
    tie( %h, DWH_File, 'myFile.dbm', O_RDWR|O_CREAT, 0644 );

    # use the hash ... 

    # cleanup
    # (necessary whenever reference values have been tampered with)
    untie %h;

=head2 A script using data in three different files

The data in one file may refer to that in another and even that
reference will be persistent.

    use Fcntl;
    use DWH_File;
    tie( %a, DWH_File, 'fileA', O_RDWR|O_CREAT, 0644 );
    tie( %b, DWH_File, 'fileB', O_RDWR|O_CREAT, 0644 );
    tie( %c, DWH_File, 'fileC', O_RDWR|O_CREAT, 0644 );

    $a{ doo } = [ qw(doo bi dee), { a => "ah", u => "uh" } ];
    $b{ bi } = $a{ doo }[ 3 ];
    # this will work

    print "$b{ bi }{ a }\n";
    # prints "ah";

    $b{ bi }{ a } = "I've changed";
    print "$a{ doo }[ 3 ]{ a }\n"; # prints "I've changed"

    # note that if - in another program - you tie %g to 'fileB'
    # without also having tied some other hash variable to 'fileA')
    # then $g{ bi } will be undefined. The actual data is in 'fileA'.
    # Moreover there will be a high risk of corrupting the data.

    # cleanup
    # (necessary whenever reference values have been tampered with)
    untie %a;
    untie %b;
    untie %c;

Earlier versions of DWH_File used a parameter to the tie() to "tag"
each file so the tied objects could reference each other. This has
now become a built-in automatic feature, which is usually simply great.
In special cases it does produce new caveats, though. Especially, if
you need to add a fourth file later on in the above example, you
have to make sure that it gets tied after all the others - at least
at the time, when the file is created.

=head2 A persistent class

Earlier versions of DWH_File demanded, that the package defining a
class set a special variable to a special value for the class to be
persistent in DWH_File.

The intention was to avoid weird results of trying to save objects
of classes which didn't know about DWH_File and thus would not work
properly when retrieved (because they didn't define methods to restore
state that DWH_File couln't restore automatically - like open
files etc.).

I've removed this limitation, so DWH_File has become more sticky.
I'm thinking of a new and more elegant way, like demanding that
classes have DWH_File::Object in their heritage. Something will
appear later.

=head1 NOTES

=head2 PLATFORMS

This version of DWH_File seems to work on all unices and I
expect it to work on Window too. I'm eager to hear from anybody
who's tested it on anything.

=head2 MLDBM

It appears that DWH_File does much of the same stuff that the MLDBM
module from CPAN does. There are substantial differences though, which
means that both modules outperform the other in certain
situations. DWH_Files main attractions are (a) it only has to load the
data actually acessed into memory (b) it restores all referential
identity (MLDBM sometimes makes duplicates) (c) it has an approach to
setting up dynamic state elements (like sockets, pipes etc.) of
objects at load time.

Also at this point, MLDBM is a near-canon part of institutionalized
Perl-culture. It may be expected to be thouroughly tested and stable.
DWH_File is just the work of a single mind (one that you have no
particular reason to trust), and to my surprise it hasn't gained
much acceptance since I first put it on CPAN sometime 2000 (I think).

=head2 (IN)COMPATIBILITY

This version cannot share files with versions 0.01 to 0.04 of DWH_File.
The format has changed dramatically. If you have legacy data that you'd
really like to convert to the new format, send me an email. I may
write a convertion facility if persuaded. I don't need one myself, so
if nobody asks for it, I probably won't make it.

=head1 CAVEATS

=over 4

=item REMEMBER UNTIE

It is very important that untie be called at the end of any script
that changes data referenced by the entries in the hash. Otherwise the
file will be corrupted. Also remember to remove any references to the
tied object before untieing.

=item BEWARE OF DBM

Using DWH_File with NDBM_File I found that arrays wouldn't hold more
than a few hundred entries. Assignment seemed to work OK but when
global destruction came along (and the data should be flushed to disk)
a segmentation error occured. It seems to me that this must be a
NDBM_File related bug. I've tried it with DB_File (under linuxPPC) -
100000 entries no problem :-)

At all times be aware of the limitations to data size imposed by the
DBM module you use. See AnyDBM_File(3) for specs of the various DMB
modules.  Also some DBM modules may not be complete (I had trouble
with the EXIST method not existing in NDBM_File).

=item BEWARE OF CIRCULAR REFERENCES

Your data may contain circular references which mean that the
reference count is above zero eventhough the data is unreachable. This
will defeat the DWH_File garbage collection scheme an thus may cause
your file to swell with useless unreachable data.

    # %h being tied to DWH_File $h{ a } = [ qw( foo bar ) ];
    push @{ $h{ a } }, $h{ a };
    # the anonymous array pointed
    # to by $h{ a } now contains a
    # reference to itself
    $h{ a } = "Gone with the wind";
    # so it's refcount will now # be 1 and it won't be garbage
    # collected

To avoid the problem, break the self reference before losing touch:

    # %h being tied to DWH_File
    $h{ a } = [ qw( foo bar ) ];
    push @{ $h{ a } }, $h{ a };
    # now break the reference
    $h{ a }[ 2 ] = '';
                              
    $h{ a } = "Gone with the wind";
    # the anonymous array will be
    # garbage collected at untie time

Currently I don't have the time to try to work out a better garbage
collection scheme for DWH_File. Sorry.

=item ALWAYS USE THE SAME FILES TOGETHER

If you use a set of hashes tied to a set of files and these hashes contain
references to data in each other you must always tie the same set of
files to hases when editing the content. Otherwise the data in the files
may become corrupted.

=item LIMITATION 1

Data structures saved to disk using DWH_File must not be tied to
any other class. DWH_File needs to internally tie the data to some
helper classes - and Perl does not allow data to be tied to more than
one class at a time.

At one point I dreamed up at workaround for this, but as of this writing
I have no plans for trying to implement it. You have a go if you want.

=item LIMITATION 2

You're not allowed to assign references to constants in the DWH
structure as in (%h being tied to DWH_File)

    $h{ statementref } = \"I am a donut";
    # won't wash

You can't do an exact equivalent, but you can of course say

    $r = "All men are born equal";
    $h{ statementref } = \$r;

=item LIMITATION 3

Autovivification doen't always work. This may depend on the DBM module
used. I haven't really investigated this problem but it seems that
the problems I have experienced using DB_File arise either from some
quirks in either DB_File or Perl itself.

This means that if you say

    %h = ();
    $h{ a }[ 3 ]{ pie } = "Apple!";

you be sure that the implicit anonymous array and hash "spring into existence"
like they should. You'll have to make them exist first:

    %h = ( a =E<gt> [ undef, undef, undef, {} ] );
    $h{ a }[ 3 ]{ pie } = "Apple!";

Strangely though I have found that often autovivification does actually work
but I can't find the pattern.

I don't plan on trying to fix this right now because it appears to be quite
mysterious and that I can't really do anything about it on DWH_File's side.

=item LIMITATION 4

DWH_File hashes store straight scalars and references (blessed or not)
to scalars, hashes and arrays - in other words: data. File handles and 
subrutine (CODE) references are not stored.

These are the only known limitations. If you encounter any others please
tell me.
